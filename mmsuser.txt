MMSUSER
=======

The MMSUSER utility provides command-line support for adding, deleting and modifying
MMSC user definitions.

The MMSUSER utility also provides reporting functionality, for exporting a list of
defined users, and for reporting message quota information on the number of messages
sent by defined accounts.

NOTE:  MMSUSER must be executed from the gateway installation directory.  Do not move or copy
MMSUSER to another directory.

The MMSUSER command operates in 5 different "modes", depending on command line parameters.

The first command line parameter defines the "mode", as described below.

==
Export user list to file:

MMSUSER -export filename

MMSUSER will export a list of defined users to the specified filename.  The format for
the export file is as follows:

M,PhoneNumber,Alias,Password,FullName,MaxMsgsPerDay,MaxMsgsPerMonth

==
Import users from file:

MMSUSER -import filename

MMSUSER will read commands from the specified filename to add, modify or delete users.

The format for the import file is as follows:

C,PhoneNumber,Alias,Password,FullName,MaxMsgsPerDay,MaxMsgsPerMonth

C is an import command, which must be M (modify), A (add), or D (delete).

The M (modify) command can be used to Add a new user or modify an existing user.

The A (add) command can only be used to add a new user.

The D (delete) command requires only the PhoneNumber as a parameter.

When processing import commands, MMSUSER will echo the status of the command to the console,
using one line per command in the following format:

C,PhoneNumber,Status

Status will be either OK or FAILED.  If status is FAILED, FAILED will be followed by
additional descriptive information regarding the nature of the failure.

==
Quota Report:

MMSUSER -quotareport filename

MMSUSER will report message quota information for all users.

The format of this file is:

--- User PhoneNumber (alias) ---
Month Day, Year -- number messages
   TOTAL - Month Year -- number messages


==
Test if Phone Number defined:

MMSUSER -exist PhoneNumber

Command returns 0 if the phone number is defined to the MMSC, non-zero if the phone number
is not defined.

==
Test if Alias is defined:

MMSUSER -existalias Alias

Command returns 0 if the alias is defined to the MMSC, non-zero if the alias is not defined.
